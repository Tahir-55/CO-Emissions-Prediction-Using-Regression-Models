# CO-Emissions-Prediction-Using-Regression-Models

This study employs three regression models to forecast CO₂ emissions from vehicles: linear regression, decision tree regression, and random forest regression. The dataset uses engine size, cylinders, and fuel consumption to forecast CO₂ emissions, the desired variable. A sophisticated data cleaning method was used to manage missing values and eliminate outliers, resulting in high-quality input data. An exploratory investigation found a considerable association between engine size and fuel consumption and CO₂ emissions, offering new insights into the elements affecting vehicle emissions. The study examined the models' performance using important metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Residual Sum of Squares (RSS), and R² Score. Among the models, the Random Forest Regressor proved to be the most accurate and trustworthy, with the best balance of generalization and accuracy. This repository contains the dataset, code for preprocessing, training, and assessment, and visualizations comparing real and expected emissions. Future initiatives might include incorporating new characteristics and using sophisticated machine learning methods to improve predicted accuracy.
